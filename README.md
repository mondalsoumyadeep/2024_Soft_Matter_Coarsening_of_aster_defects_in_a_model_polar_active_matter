In our work, we solved a non-linear coupled partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the dynamics of 2D polar active matter. This model captures complex biological phenomena and is used to describe the interplay between actin and myosin in the cell cortex.

The main_code.py file is used to solve the non-linear coupled PDE and store the data in the data folder.

The main_analyze.py file generates the plots.

The Plots folder contains a Jupyter notebook used to plot the data presented in the paper.

The defect_dynamics.py file is used to characterize topological defects with different charges and configurations, specifically +/-1.

In the pdf, We examine the effect of the different parameters on the system.
